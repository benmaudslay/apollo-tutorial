# Apollo-Tutorial
Tutorial to build a full-stack GraphQL-powered app with the Apollo platform.

The functions like Airbnb but for space flights.

The tutorial can be found here: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/

The tutorial is now outdated and the final app does not work.

I am modifying my own version of this app and it exists here: COMING SOON
